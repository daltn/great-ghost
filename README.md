# Nudity For Beginners

Web-based audio/visual piece made in collaboration with artist/musician, Sean Kravit.

The design of the piece was influenced by the idea of nudity as a metaphor for emotional vulnerability. A bank of questions are shuffled using the Fisher-Yates algorithm and the first three are displayed to the user which probes the user's notions of their ego & thought process. The user's answers are then embedded and animated as a part of the music video.
