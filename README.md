# Nudity For Beginners

Web-based audio/visual piece made in collaboration with artist/musician, Sean Kravit.

This piece was influenced by the idea of nudity as a metaphor for emotional vulnerability. A bank of questions are shuffled and three of them are displayed to the user. These questions examine the notion of ego & self-reflection. The answers are then embedded and animated as a part of the music video.
